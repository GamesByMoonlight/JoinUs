I took all the sounds from freesound.org and have their proper attributions listed below.
I would not use these in the final development of the game/prototype, it is only for
demonstration purposes. I would also normally not create a folder specifically for my
additions/assets added but wanted to keep them separate.

sound attributions - 

"Bike, Bell Ding, Single, 01-01.wav" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org
"Explosion, 8-bit, 01.wav" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org
"Hmm question" by esperar of Freesound.org
